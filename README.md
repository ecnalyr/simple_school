Simple School
================

This application is created as a demonstration of development ability after given this description:

> We like you to model the student - assignment - submission relationship. There is a student who is "registered" for a class, and that class has assignments. A student needs to be able to see what assignments they have open, and submit results. You do not need to worry about authentication or authorization, Ui or how a user "registers". We are really just looking for an understanding of what your day to day working knowledge is. You should be able to add multiple students, classes and assignments.
once you finish please send github / heroku links
